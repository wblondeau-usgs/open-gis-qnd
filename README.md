The Quick And Dirty guide to various open GIS specifications

_"It can be quick; it can be dirty; but true documentary synergy requires both."_

This repo is by intention a simple introduction to selected core specifications from the [Open Geospatial Consortium](http://www.opengeospatial.org/), together with some supporting specs. It is **not** intended to be a complete survey of the OGC specs; or in fact a complete survey of anything. It is ad-hoc. It may not be a sufficient resource for any given project.

What is guaranteed is that:

 - Any spec addressed here will be clearly and simply described.
 - Any spec addressed here will include a link to official published specification
 - Any spec addressed here will include links to helpful non-normative resources
 - This guide will include notable incidents, peculiarities, gotchas, and easily missed points.
